# The contract address is generated when the contract is deployed to the blockchain. In the code I provided, you would replace contract_address with the actual address of the deployed smart contract.

# To deploy a smart contract to the blockchain, you will need to use a tool such as Remix, Truffle, or a similar tool that allows you to write, deploy, and interact with smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

# Once you have deployed the contract to the blockchain, you can retrieve its address using the appropriate method provided by your tool of choice. For example, in Truffle, you can retrieve the address from the contract instance as follows:

# contract_instance = MyToken.deployed()
# contract_address = contract_instance.address


import web3

def monitor_transactions(w3, address, contract_address):
    # Get the latest block number
    latest_block = w3.eth.blockNumber

    # Define the smart contract ABI
    abi = [...]

    # Get the smart contract instance
    contract = w3.eth.contract(address=contract_address, abi=abi)

    # Monitor new transactions in the first wallet
    while True:
        latest_block = w3.eth.blockNumber
        block = w3.eth.getBlock(latest_block, True)
        for tx in block['transactions']:
            # Check if the transaction is from or to the first wallet
            if tx['to'] == address or tx['from'] == address:
                # Get the details of the transaction
                amount = tx['value']
                to = tx['to']
                from_ = tx['from']
                # Call the smart contract function to make the same transaction on the second wallet
                contract.functions.transfer(to, amount).transact({'from': from_})
